Welcome to my simple web game that uses SVG elements to simulate a space invaders game. 
To play the game, simply download the files to your computer, and open the index.html file in Google Chrome.
Make sure the main.js and images folder are in the same directory as the index.html file.
Use the left and right arror keys to move the player's space ship from side to side.
Use the up arrow to fire.
Enjoy!
